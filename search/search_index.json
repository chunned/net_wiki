While the certification you choose can be for any of the major cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure), most people choose AWS due to it having the largest market share. </p> <p>Amazon offers a program in which you can claim a 100% off voucher, allowing you to get your certification for free. The catch is: the process of obtaining this voucher will take months, and you need to start well before you start the Cloud Services class in order to obtain it in time. </p> <p>Note that this information applies to the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. The process for other certifications may be slightly different. </p> <p>First, you need to complete the two following AWS Skill Builder courses - Exam Prep Official Question Set: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02 - English) - Exam Prep Standard Course: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02 - English)</p> <p>After you have completed these courses, you need to join the AWS Emerging Talent Community. Once signed up, you will have access to activities that you can complete for a small amount of points. You need 3500 points to redeem the voucher, but there are only so many activities you can complete each week, which will typically net you 20-100 points. </p>"},{"location":"Career%20Resources/Certifications/#miscellaneous","title":"Miscellaneous","text":""},{"location":"Career%20Resources/Certifications/#security","title":"Security","text":""},{"location":"Career%20Resources/Certifications/#-blue-team-level-1","title":"- Blue Team Level 1","text":""},{"location":"Career%20Resources/Resumes/","title":"Resumes","text":"<ul> <li>15 Free ATS Resume Templates<ul> <li>Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are used by organizations to basically scan applicant resumes.

It was named Wabbit because it worked very quickly; so quickly, in fact, that the system would normally run out of processing power and end up crashing. It is known as the first truly malicious program and grew from concepts created by other computer scientists. It was not a worm (it did not travel over a network), it only infected the machine it was on. </p> <p>Today, it would be referred to as a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack known as a fork bomb. </p> <p>It works by creating an infinite loop that creates system processes and copies of the original file. This caused an abnormally high number of CPU cycles and would clog the system, causing it to crash - this is the concept of a fork bomb. </p>"},{"location":"Miscellaneous/Brief%20History%20of%20Malware/#animal-1975","title":"ANIMAL - 1975","text":"<p>In 1975, the first Trojan virus was written, called ANIMAL, created by John Walker. It would act as a game which asked the user a number of questions in order to guess the animal they were thinking of.  While the user was playing the \"game\", a program in the background was running. PERVADE would create a copy of itself and ANIMAL in every directory that the user had access to. The term Trojan refers to the Trojan Horse of Ancient Greece. The Greeks built a giant wooden horse and sent it as a gift to the independent city of Troy - but had hidden armed men inside it, who broke out and infiltrated the city. This is analogous to how the virus hides itself, making the user think it is an innocent program while the malicious part happens in the background.  However, ANIMAL was not made with malicious intent. It was written to make sure that the directory structure was not damaged. It was eventually stopped by an OS upgrade, which changed the file status tables that PERVADE used to copy the files. </p>"},{"location":"Miscellaneous/Brief%20History%20of%20Malware/#elk-cloner-1982","title":"Elk Cloner - 1982","text":"<p>In 1982, a 15 year old high school student named Richard Skrenta created one of the first microcomputer viruses that spread outside of a controlled system (i.e. a single computer or laboratory).  Elk Cloner attached itself to the Apple II operating system and spread through floppy disks. Skrenta wrote it as a prank on his friends.  The technique it used is now called boot sector virus. The program was placed in a game and did nothing until the 50th time the game was opened, upon which it would change to a blank screen and display a poem about the virus.  If the computer booted from an infected floppy disk, the virus was placed in the computers memory; meaning it would then spread to any disk inserted into the computer.</p>"},{"location":"Miscellaneous/Brief%20History%20of%20Malware/#cascade-1988","title":"Cascade - 1988","text":"<p>Cascade was the first type of malware to use encryption - it did not directly damage user data, but simply kept the program undetected.

Morris was the first person in the United States to be arrested under the 1986 Comptuer Fraud and Abuse Act.  The worm spread by exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in Unix Sendmail, remote shells, and weak passwords, and did lead to global awareness of the danger of having a weak password.  It infected 2000 computers within 15 hours and often took more than 2 days to remove from a single computer. It reportedly infected a total of 6000 computers, around 10% of the Internet at the time. </p>"},{"location":"Miscellaneous/Domain%20Tools/","title":"Domain Tools","text":"<p>Info</p> <p>Tools related to domains and/or IP addresses, ASNs, certificates, etc.</p>"},{"location":"Miscellaneous/Domain%20Tools/#domains","title":"Domains","text":""},{"location":"Miscellaneous/Domain%20Tools/#web-tools","title":"Web Tools","text":"<ul> <li>URLVoid - check domain reputation</li> <li>DNSDumpster - query DNS records, geoIP, subdomains, domain map</li> <li>crt.sh - query TLS certificates for a domain</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Miscellaneous/Domain%20Tools/#cli","title":"CLI","text":"<ul> <li>Amass<ul> <li><code>amass enum -src -ip -brute -d [url]</code></li> <li>Slowest, but most thorough</li> </ul> </li> <li>Sublist3r<ul> <li><code>python3 sublist3r.py -d [url]</code></li> <li>Fast, but only finds common subdomains</li> </ul> </li> <li>Photon</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Miscellaneous/Domain%20Tools/#ip-addresses","title":"IP Addresses","text":"<ul> <li>IPVoid</li> <li>AbuseIPDB</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Miscellaneous/Educational%20Platforms/","title":"Educational Platforms","text":"<p>Info</p> <p>Hands-on security education platforms.
